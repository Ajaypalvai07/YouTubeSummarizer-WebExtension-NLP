# YouTubeSummarizer-WebExtension-NLP
Developed a YouTubeSummarizer using Hugging Face transformer for efficient text summarization. Simplifies user experience with a Chrome extension, enabling one-click video transcript summarization.






Project Title:
YouTubeSummarizer-WebExtension-NLP

Project Description:
In this project, I present a comprehensive solution for text summarization of YouTube video transcripts. The core of the summarization process utilizes a Hugging Face transformer, renowned for its efficacy in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This pre-trained model significantly enhances the summarization performance.

To simplify the user experience and reduce complexity, I have developed a Chrome extension. Users can effortlessly add this extension to their browser, enabling them to generate a summary for a specific YouTube video with a simple click on the "Summarize" button.

**Overview:**
YouTubeSummarizer-WebExtension-NLP is a project designed to streamline the process of obtaining concise summaries for YouTube video transcripts using Natural Language Processing techniques. The core technology leverages a Hugging Face transformer with a pre-trained model for efficient text summarization.

**Features:**
Hugging Face Transformer: Utilizes a powerful pre-trained model for accurate and efficient text summarization.
Chrome Extension: Simplifies the summarization process by providing users with a one-click solution directly from their browser.


How to Use:

Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
